    <p>You arrive at the edge of the garden stage. A crowd of critters is gathered.</p>
    <p>A group of squirrels — clad in makeshift vests and glowy leaf bands — begin their routine.</p>
    <blockquote><em>"That’s... the Acorn Underground," Chatter gasps. "They’re using tail signals — this is a drop."</em></blockquote>
    <p>Hazel whispers, “We can watch and decode... or cut the show and question them directly.”</p>
