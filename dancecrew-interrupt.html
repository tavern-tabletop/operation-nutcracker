  <section class="story-beat">
    <p>You step in mid-routine, clearing your throat. “We’ve got questions.”</p>
    <p>The music cuts. All eyes turn to you. One dancer slowly removes their acorn headphones.</p>
    <blockquote><em>“RUDE,” mutters Sway. “We were about to drop a coded tailspin!”</em></blockquote>
    <p>“Now we have to start over,” groans Jukebox. You missed the signal... but made some new enemies.</p>
    <p>“Next time,” whispers Hazel, “let the artists finish.”</p>
